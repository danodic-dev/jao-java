/**
 * This is the main class for the Jao library. The instance of this class is
 * provided by parsing a JSON file using the JaoParser class.
 *
 * This class allows to interface with the events contained in the JSON file and
 * execute them through a renderer.
 *
 * The renderer is the actual piece of code that materializes the contents of
 * the .jao file in the screen. What the Jao class does is to orchestrate the
 * execution of all events on all layers and stopping, reseting, looping and
 * etc.
 *
 * In case the JSON file has a "default" event defined for at least one of the
 * layers, you can just call render() right after getting the instance from the
 * parser. If there is no "default" event defined, you'll have to call
 * setEvent() to define the first event to be executed.
 *
 * The libraries mentioned in the JSON file are scanned from the classpath when
 * the parsing starts, and they have to be defined by the user of the class.
 * There should be a default library with sample entries as a separate project
 * that can be added as another dependency in the project, but nothing avoids
 * the programmer to implement new libraries and mix and match them with the
 * existing ones. Take a look at the IAction and IInitializer interfaces to
 * understand how it is done.
